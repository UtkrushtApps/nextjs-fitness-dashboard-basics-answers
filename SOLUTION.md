# Solution Steps

1. Create a TypeScript interface for Workout in 'types/workout.ts'.

2. Implement the /api/workouts Next.js route in 'app/api/workouts/route.ts' that returns mocked workouts data asynchronously.

3. Implement the /api/analytics/log route in 'app/api/analytics/log/route.ts' to simulate logging analytics of workout engagement via POST.

4. In 'app/dashboard/page.tsx', fetch workouts data asynchronously in useEffect, handling loading and errors with type safety.

5. Render all workouts in responsive cards with workout details.

6. On each card, add a 'Log Progress' button. When clicked, trigger a non-blocking POST to '/api/analytics/log', and show a temporary 'Logging...' UI feedback on the button (using state to track by workout id).

7. Ensure all API and UI logic is type-safe and the UI does not block/wait for analytics; instead the button disables and spins back after a short timeout.

8. Review grid responsiveness and error handling for a robust dashboard display.
